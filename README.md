# MigraCare - Digital Health Record Management System

## Project Overview

**MigraCare** is a comprehensive digital health record management system specifically designed for migrant workers in Kerala, India. This mobile-first Progressive Web Application (PWA) addresses the critical healthcare challenges faced by Kerala's 3.1 million migrant workers while supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and government policy initiatives.

## Problem Statement

Kerala hosts a significant migrant population lacking comprehensive health record systems. These individuals often serve as carriers for infectious diseases, posing serious public health risks to local communities. A dedicated software solution for maintaining migrant health records would support SDG achievement, prevent disease transmission, enhance public health surveillance, and assist in disease elimination while ensuring fair and impartial healthcare access.
